## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile Methodology
Advantages:

Flexibility for changes.
Close customer collaboration.
Early and frequent delivery of value.
Reduced risk through iterative development.
Disadvantages:

Potential for unclear end goals.
Resource-intensive due to continuous stakeholder engagement.
Less emphasis on comprehensive documentation.
Waterfall Methodology
Advantages:

Structured and predictable process.
Detailed documentation at each phase.
Clear timelines and cost estimates.
Disadvantages:

Inflexible to changes once underway.
Testing occurs late, potentially leading to costly fixes.
Limited customer feedback until later stages.


## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile is more beneficial for:
Dynamic Projects: Where requirements change frequently (e.g., startups, mobile apps).
Collaborative Teams: Cross-functional teams that value continuous feedback.
Innovative Products: Projects requiring iterative development (e.g., software for emerging tech like AI).
Example: Developing a social media app where features evolve based on user feedback.
Waterfall is more beneficial for:
Stable Requirements: Projects with well-defined, unchanging goals (e.g., regulatory compliance software).
Predictable Timelines: Projects with strict deadlines and budgets (e.g., construction management systems).
Linear Processes: Sequential workflows where each phase must be completed before the next begins.
Example: Building a payroll system for a large corporation with fixed requirements.


## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Methods for Ensuring Quality Assurance in Software Projects
Code Reviews:

Static Code Analysis:

Use tools to analyze code for potential issues like security vulnerabilities or performance bottlenecks.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT):

Involve end-users to validate the software meets their needs and expectations.
Documentation:

Maintain clear documentation for requirements, design, and processes to ensure consistency.
Performance Testing:

Test software under load to ensure it meets performance requirements.
Importance of Maintaining High Standards
Customer Satisfaction:

High-quality software meets user needs, reducing frustration and improving trust.
Cost Efficiency:

Fixing bugs early is cheaper than addressing them post-release.
Reputation:

Quality software enhances a company’s reputation and competitive edge.
Security:

High standards reduce vulnerabilities, protecting user data and systems.
Maintainability:

Well-tested and documented code is easier to update and scale.


## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Project Scope:
Defines goals, deliverables, and limits.
Prevents scope creep, ensures clarity, and aids resource allocation.
Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):
Breaks project into manageable tasks.
Improves planning, tracking, and accountability.
